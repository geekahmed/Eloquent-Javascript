        <h2>Exercise 2 : Recursion</h2>
        <p>
				We’ve seen that % (the remainder operator) can be used to test whether a
number is even or odd by using % 2 to see whether it’s divisible by two. Here’s
another way to define whether a positive whole number is even or odd: <br/>
• Zero is even.<br/>
• One is odd.<br/>
• For any other number N, its evenness is the same as N - 2.<br/>
Define a recursive function isEven corresponding to this description. The<br/>
function should accept a single parameter (a positive, whole number) and return<br/>
a Boolean.<br/>
Test it on 50 and 75. See how it behaves on -1. Why? Can you think of a<br/>
way to fix this?
