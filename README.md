**Eloquent Javascript**

JavaScript lies at the heart of almost every modern web application, from social apps like Twitter to browser-based game frameworks like Phaser and Babylon. Though simple for beginners to pick up and play with, JavaScript is a flexible, complex language that you can use to build full-scale applications.  
  
This much anticipated and thoroughly revised third edition of _Eloquent JavaScript_ dives deep into the JavaScript language to show you how to write beautiful, effective code. It has been updated to reflect the current state of JavaÂ¬Script and web browsers and includes brand-new material on features like class notation, arrow functions, iterators, async functions, template strings, and block scope.
